## Disclaimer

This project is a (nearly) direct rip-off of BLOKK (http://blokkfont.com). The idea is simple and brilliant, but I wasn't happy with the implementation and it didn't appear to be an open source project, so I created my own. Credit where credit is due.

## FAQ

- **Q: What's different about this compared to BLOKK?**
A: Oddly, BLOKK has unusually large character widths, which adds much length to "standard" bits of dummy text, and also creates unecessarily ragged rags in my copy. Redacted solves this by using sane character widths; matching narrow, regular, and wide blocks to their respective characters. This gives a more realistic look to the text and helps it fit into narrow columns like real text would.

- **Q: Isn't this a lot of work for a relatively small change?**
 A: I'm a nerd, and it was fun.
